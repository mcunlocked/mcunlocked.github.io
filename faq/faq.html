      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <ol>
        <b><li>Will this work on servers?</li></b>
        <p>No, however it will work with limited functionality for viewing the Far Lands without jitter.</p>
        <br>
        <b><li>How well does it work?</li></b>
        <p>The mod applies only a bare minimum of patches for a usable experience. However, b1.7.3 has rendering patches up to a r1.8 level.</p>
        <br>
        <b><li>What versions will the MCUnlocked project cover?</li></b>
        <p>The version range will go from inf-20100227-2 all the way to r1.7.10 excluding snapshots and minor releases unless there's a major noteworthy aspect of that version. Infdev+ from the Legacy+ trilogy is currently supported.</p>
        <br>
        <b><li>Will minor versions be supported in the future?</li></b>
        <p>Possibly, at the moment however, going through the latest revisions is more efficient plan.</p>
        <br>
        <b><li>How is Infdev+ supported?</li></b>
        <p>Using bytecode editing with Recaf, editing Infdev+'s code is possible, allowing for MCUnlocked to work, with some extra pain due to obfuscation.</p>
        <br>
        <b><li>1.8+?</li></b>
        <p>In the future maybe, but currently I don't see why that would be necessary since mods like FarLandsMod, FarLandsModV2, Simulati and others exist. I might consider it though.</p>
        <br>
        <b><li>Why are some versions prioritized and patched over others?</li></b>
        <p>For major noteworthy versions, like b1.7.3, versions can be prioritized over others and be given extra patches. When the entire modding project is finished however, I might consider going over every mod and "polishing" them.</p>
        <br>
        <b><li>Why does this modding project even exist?</li></b>
        <p>As a person who likes to explore and see the outer limits of the game, the worldborder struck me as annoying and useless, and as my masochistical self who likes to create completely random and long projects, I decided to do this, so that's why this entire project even exists.</p>
        <br>
        <b><li>How was this website made?</li></b>
        <p>This website was made entirely by myself with HTML, CSS, some JS and my passion for web development.</p>
        <br>
        <b><li>Will it be open source?</li></b>
        <p>Sadly the mod can't be open source, since distributing decompiled and unobfuscated code is against Mojang's EULA.</p>
        <br>
        <b><li>How do I install it?</li></b>
        <p>Add it as a jar mod in MultiMC or Prism, in BetaCraft it's a bit complicated though. Visit the Installation Guide for more accurate instructions.</p>
