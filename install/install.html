      <h1>Installation instructions</h1>
      <h3>MultiMC / Prism Launcher</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Head to the downloads section, find the version you want to download, then download it.</li>
        <li>Create or add the downloaded mod to an instance by using the "Add to Minecraft Jar" button.</li>
        <li>Launch the instance.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Betacraft</h3>
        <b>Note: it is highly recommended that MCUnlocked is installed on MultiMC or Prism, since installing it on Betacraft is complicated and has a lot of steps.</b>
        <p>Instructions coming soon</p>
      <h3>Official Launcher</h3>
      <b>As stated in the Betacraft instructions, it is recommended for MCUnlocked to be installed on Prism or MultiMC. These instructions haven't been tested and might not work.</b>
      <ol>
        <li>Launch the game version you want to install MCUnlocked on once to ensure that it has downloaded.</li>
        <li>Open %appdata%/.minecraft on Windows. On MacOS, press CMD+SHIFT+G and paste ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft into the text box. On Linux navigate to home/(username)/.minecraft.</li>
        <li>Open the versions folder. If the versions folder isn't present make sure to either install the official launcher, or repeat step 1.</li>
        <li>Find the version that you launched. e.g. b1.7.3 or 1.7.10</li>
        <li>Go into that directory, then on Windows, if you have 7zip or WinRAR installed, open the jar. On MacOS, using a utility like The Unarchiver, unzip it into a folder. On Linux, use an archive viewer.</li>
        <li>On Windows, open the zip file of MCUnlocked, then select the class files, and drag them into the currently opened jar file. If you get a replacement prompt, click "Yes". On MacOS, unzip MCUnlocked, and copy the class files from MCUnlocked into the jar file that was extracted. On Linux do the same as Windows.</li>
        <li>Now that you have a modified class file, rename it to whatever the version number is, then add -unlocked to the end (NOT THE FILE EXTENSION!)</li>
        <li>Download the custom json file from the downloads page in the "other" section.</li>
        <li>Go back to the versions folder in the minecraft directory and create a new folder named in the format of "versionname-unlocked".</li>
        <li>Drag the json and the jar into the new folder. Make sure that the jar and json are named in the "versionname-unlocked" format as well, e.g. 1.7.10-unlocked.json or b1.8.1-unlocked.jar</li>
        <li>Open the json file in a text editor, preferably VSCode or related editors.</li>
        <li>Find versionname-unlocked and replace that with your version as specified above.</li>
        <li>MacOS only: find the folder with your class files, select everything in the folder, compress it into a zip file, then rename the zip file at the end from .zip to .jar</li>
        <li>Launch the game and hope that it works.</li>
